Thank you for downloading our Joomla 1.5 template themza_j15_17 !

Here's how you can add any Joomla 1.5 template to your Joomla 1.5.x installation:

1. By uploading it via FTP to the `your-joomla1.5.x-installation/templates/' directory

2. By browsing the template's zip archive from your Joomla Administration Panel:
'Extensions' » 'Install/Uninstall', then push the 'Upload File & Install' button

3. Again from the Administration Panel, set the template - themza_j15_17 - as 'Default' by browsing to 'Extensions' » 'Template Manager' and pushing the 'Default' button (located in the top right corner of the page).

4. Finally, in 'Template Manager' click on the template name to access its template options.

Enjoy!
